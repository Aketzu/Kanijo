# PISARASI

Pisarasi.fi is an online service that lets you log where you have been for the last two weeks. This helps identify chains of infection, making it easier to stop the virus from spreading. 

Pisarasi is Finnish and means "Droplets". 

## How it works?

Users can input data about where they have been, how many people have come into close contact etc. Some baseline data can be easily added by downloading existing Google Location history and uploading it to this service. (Assuming user has Google Location history turned on and is preferably using Android mobile phone.)

Users can use this diary as a prefilled "information form" when doing an interview with healthcare or other officials doing contact tracing or if need be, to see who (e.g. friends, acquaintaces, venues..) they need to contact if healthcare isn't able to trace contacts anymore.

## Plans for future

**More data sources** - Further development would be to get GPS tracking data from other applications (e.g. fitness trackers or other cellphone location tracking apps) and parse visits from there.

**My places** - add your regularly visited locations, like home, work, grocery store and pharmacy into your account and quickly refine the import or add new entries.

**Social circles** - add your family members, close colleagues and other people you meet with regularly as a circle member. You can add circle members to your places.

With large enough user base this could also alert healthcare or users whether you had crossed paths with infected persons and direct users to take proper actions based on their location.
